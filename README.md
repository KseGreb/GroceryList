 ABOUT THE PROJECT 
## About The Project

### REASONS WHY YOU SHOULD USE SHOPPING LISTS  ###  

 🚀 SAVES MONEY - By sticking to a list, you’ll resist the temptation to go off on tangents and buy things you don’t really need. 

 🚀 SAVES TIME - With a list in hand, you’ll glide through the aisles much quicker, ditching the indecision and scooping up only what you need. 

 🚀 LESS TRIPS TO THE SHOPS - Using a shopping list you won’t need to make multiple visits during the week to pick up odds and ends. 

 🚀 EAT HEALTHIER - Planning ahead can help you evaluate the types of food you’re consuming and avoid last-minute unhealthy decisions. 

 🚀 LESS STRESS - With a list to guide you, you can navigate the crowded aisles with ease and get everything you need without any unnecessary stress. 

 🚀 LESS FOOD WASTE - Not only will it prevent you from buying unnecessary items, but sticking to the essentials means less food ending up in the rubbish.
